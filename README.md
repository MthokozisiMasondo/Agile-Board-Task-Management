# Agile Board - Kanban Task Management App

##  My Contributions
###  In this project, I focused on improving the functionality and user experience of the Agile task board. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of my contributions:

- Debugged Existing Code: Identified and resolved issues in the code to improve stability and performance.
- Sidebar Toggle: Added a toggle feature to the sidebar, allowing for a more dynamic and space-efficient interface.
- Task Management: Implemented features for adding new tasks and saving them persistently.
- Displaying Saved Tasks: Ensured that tasks are dynamically rendered on the page after they are saved, creating a smooth and interactive experience.

These changes enhanced the board's usability and functionality, providing a better tool for managing tasks in an Agile environment.
